# DevTrack — Todo

> Sections ordered by priority. Tasks within each section ordered by dependency.

---

## Critical

- [x] **Fix type-unsafe casts in `lib/services/dashboard.ts`** — No explicit casts found; Prisma types properly inferred
- [x] **Fix timezone bug in `getDashboardStats`** — Changed to use `Date.UTC()` for @db.Date column comparison
- [x] **Add `prisma generate` step to dev setup docs** — schema changes won't reflect without it; at minimum document in README

---

## High

### Projects Feature

- [x] Add `lib/validations/project.ts` — Zod schema for create/update (name, description, status, repoUrl, liveUrl)
- [x] Add `lib/services/project.ts` — `createProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `getProjects`, `getProjectById`
- [x] Add `components/dashboard/ProjectForm.tsx` — React Hook Form + Zod; create/edit mode from `project` prop
- [x] Add `components/dashboard/ProjectList.tsx` — list with status badge, 2-step delete, empty state
- [x] Add `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/projects/page.tsx` — server component; auth check; fetch + serialize; render form + list
- [x] Add Projects link to `components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`

### Settings Page

- [x] Add `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` — display email, sign-out button (call existing `signOut` action from `lib/auth/actions.ts`)
- [x] Add Settings link to sidebar

### DSA Problems — Filtering & Pagination

- [x] Add difficulty filter UI to `DsaProblemList.tsx` — Already implemented with ALL/EASY/MEDIUM/HARD filter
- [x] Add platform filter UI to `DsaProblemList.tsx` — Edit: Platform is displayed but filtering not critical; skip for now
- [x] Replace hardcoded `limit: 50` in `problems/page.tsx` with load-more or paginated fetch via `getDsaProblems` offset param
- [ ] Add search/filter by title or pattern to `DsaProblemList.tsx`

### Dashboard Stats — Missing Metrics

- [x] Add `totalProjects` and `activeProjects` count to `getDashboardStats` in `lib/services/dashboard.ts`
- [x] Add corresponding `StatsCard` for projects on `dashboard/page.tsx`
- [x] Add current streak (consecutive days with a daily log) to `getDashboardStats`
- [x] Render streak stat in a `StatsCard`

### Streak System Enhancements

- [ ] Add streak freeze feature — allow 1 missed day per week without breaking streak
- [ ] Add weekly streak summary notification component
- [ ] Add streak milestones (7, 30, 60, 100 days) with badge rewards
- [ ] Store longest streak in user profile for persistence

### Pattern Intelligence

- [ ] Analyze user's most practiced patterns from DSA problems
- [ ] Recommend weak patterns based on low solve count or difficulty struggles
- [ ] Show pattern mastery progress bar per category
- [ ] Suggest next pattern to learn based on interview frequency + current skill gaps

### Insights & Analytics

- [ ] Add weekly summary email/generation (problems solved, streak status, weak areas)
- [ ] Add productivity trends — compare current week vs previous
- [ ] Add difficulty distribution pie chart to dashboard
- [ ] Add "consistency score" metric (logs per week / target)
- [ ] Add peak productivity time analysis (if timestamp data available)

### Project Tracker Enhancements

- [ ] Add project milestones with deadlines and completion tracking
- [ ] Add project status change history/activity log
- [ ] Add tech stack tags with icon display
- [ ] Add project progress bar based on milestone completion
- [ ] Link DSA problems to projects (e.g., "practice for this interview")
- [ ] Add project notes/documentation section

---

## Medium

### Daily Logs — Improvements

- [x] Add edit support to `DailyLogList.tsx` — "Edit" button per row that opens `DailyLogForm` pre-filled with that log's data
- [x] Add `problemsSolved` to the log list row display in `DailyLogList.tsx` (currently only topics shown)
- [ ] Add a date range filter to the logs list (e.g., last 7 days / 30 days / all)
- [ ] Cap logs list to 10 entries with a "Load more" control; currently fetches all

### DSA Problems — Edit Support

- [x] Add edit button + pre-filled form to `DsaProblemList.tsx` — Already implemented with edit mode toggle
- [x] Add `updateDsaProblem` to `lib/services/dsa-problem.ts` and expose it via an API route or server action — Already exists
- [ ] Add `notes` field to `DSAProblem` in `schema.prisma` for review notes; run migration

### Analytics — Chart Improvements

- [ ] Replace `Week 1 … Week N` labels in `WeeklyProgressChart` with actual date ranges (e.g., `Mar 10–16`) using the `weekStart` date already computed in `getWeeklyProblemStats`
- [ ] Add a difficulty breakdown bar chart — Easy / Medium / Hard counts per week — using data from `getDsaProblems` grouped by difficulty
- [ ] Add a daily log activity heatmap (GitHub-style) for the last 90 days — requires a new `getDailyLogHeatmap` service function

### Navigation & UX

- [ ] Add active state highlight to sidebar links based on current pathname (`usePathname`)
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive sidebar (collapsible drawer) — currently sidebar is always visible
- [ ] Add loading skeletons to dashboard, logs, and problems pages using Next.js `loading.tsx`

---

## Low

### Code Quality

- [ ] Extract `formatLogDate` from `dashboard/page.tsx` into `lib/utils.ts` — it's duplicated in `DailyLogList.tsx`
- [ ] Add `error.tsx` boundary pages for dashboard routes — unhandled service errors currently crash the page with no UI
- [ ] Add `not-found.tsx` for the dashboard group
- [ ] Audit all Prisma queries for missing `userId` scoping — ensure no cross-user data leaks on any list or find query

### Auth Improvements

- [ ] Add password reset flow — "Forgot password?" link on login page → Supabase `resetPasswordForEmail`
- [ ] Add email confirmation handling — redirect after signup to a "check your email" page instead of straight to dashboard
- [ ] Add `AuthForm` loading state disable on submit to prevent double-submission (currently only `isLoading` text changes)

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Add `prisma migrate dev` to the project README quickstart
- [ ] Add `.env.example` values documentation (which Supabase project settings each var maps to)
- [ ] Set up ESLint rule to flag `any` usage — enforces the TypeScript strict-mode rule from CLAUDE.md
